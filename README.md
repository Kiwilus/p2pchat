ðŸ”— How P2P Connection Works

1. **Open a Chat Room**
cargo run -- open

This command creates a new chat room and generates a ticket.
Share this ticket with your friends so they can join the same room.
Your terminal will display a TopicId and a ticket string.

2. **Join a Chat Room**
cargo run -- join <ticket>

Replace <ticket> with the ticket received from the room opener.
Connects your client to the existing chat room using encrypted P2P communication.
Once connected, you can send and receive messages directly with other peers.

3. **Send Messages**

Type your message in the terminal and press Enter to broadcast it to all connected peers.
All messages are encrypted and transmitted peer-to-peer without a central server.
